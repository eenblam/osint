# TikTok Unlocked
A simple Chrome extension version of `bookmarklet.js` in the parent directory.

To install, you'll need to load this directory as an unpacked extension.
Here are [the docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#:~:text=To%20load%20an%20unpacked%20extension,the%20bottom%20of%20the%20menu.) on that.

Some notes:

* I need to replace the logo eventually maybe who knows.
* This *probably* works on Firefox without many changes, but I haven't tested it yet.
* I don't really do much front-end, so if I'm doing something funky here or could be using the related async APIs better, please feel free to open an issue and make suggestions. I'm always happy to learn! :)
